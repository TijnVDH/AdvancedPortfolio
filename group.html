            <p class="desc">
                Welcome to the reading guide of the group project for this semester! In this reading guide, various topics will be discussed, including the project, process, reflection and evaluation.
                At the bottom of this reading guide, you will find a proof section containing all deliverables related to this project. These deliverables have certain learning outcomes attached to them, which
                are visisble when hovering over said deliverables. The deliverables from this project, and all other projects are also directly accessible from the competence table on the homepage. The difference
                is that on the homepage, all deliverables are sorted by learning outcomes, while this page only contains deliverables for this specific project.

            <h2 class="guide">THE PROJECT</h2>
            <p class="desc">The group project is based around Grip On Sound. Grip on Sound is a project within FHICT where multiple project groups work on separate parts. Grip On Sound is creating a smartwatch and smartphone app for physical education teachers of primarily primary schools in the Netherlands. </p>
              <div class="column">
                <p class="company">
                  Physical education lessons are usually very loud, and physical education teachers are exposed to these loud noises throughout the day. This makes the possibility of hearing damage high. Hence the opportunity was taken to create a smartwatch and smartphone app to raise awareness on sound levels.
                </p>
                <p class="company">
                  For the group project, a total of six students including me have been assigned to create the design of the smartphone app. This meant that the end product was a functional prototype of the smartphone app, with complete branding, and most importantly validation.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Approach</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              The duration of the project was twelve weeks. During these twelve weeks, the group has worked in a total of six sprints. Every sprint a new SCRUM master was assigned. This was done to give everybody equal opportunities to take the lead in the group, and keep track of the progress.
            </p>
            <div class="column">
              <p class="company">
                During my third-year internship. I started working with the SCRUM way of working. During this internship period I was working alone, and this way of working suited me very well. This however was different: there was a group which meant that everyone was picking up tasks and simultaneously working on different things.
              </p>
              <p class="company">
                Every Wednesday, a stand-up meeting was held by the Grip on Sound team. Two to three group members attended these stand-ups to give updates about the project each time. I took the initiative to attend the majority of these stand-ups. Once every two weeks, there was a meeting with the direct stakeholder, Dennis, after the stand-up.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="desc">
              In these meetings, the group would go more in-depth on the work and show progress. Besides only these meetings with the stakeholder, there were several meetings where specific topics were discusses. These were for example the requirements of the smartphone app. Besides our stakeholder, we also had our coach to help out and give advice where needed.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              After each sprint, the group held a retrospective and the role of SCRUM master was passed along. During these retrospectives, the SCRUM board is evaluated and updated where needed, and the group productivity was discussed. Based on these results, improvement points were made which helped the group move forward in future sprints.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Execution</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              The first sprint of the project started out by setting up diving into previous work that had been done, and setting up a project plan. This project plan included the main approach, and most importantly the main research question:
              <ul class="target-list">
                <li>How can we use a smartphone app to give insights to PE teachers on hearing damage caused by loud noises during their lessons?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              Based on this main question, several sub questions were created, which can be found inside of the project plan. Every group member gave their preference on certain sub questions, which was the first division of tasks that had been made. For me, I mainly focused on the following sub questions:
              <ul class="target-list">
                <li>In what way can we visualize data in order to make sure it is insightful for our target audience?</li>
                <li>What type of data will help the user become completely aware of potential hearing damage?</li>
                <li>How can we test the UI/UX of the app?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              After having completed the set of research questions, everybody had their tasks to do. The group functioned in a double diamond way of working, while keeping fluctuation into consideration. The expectation was that multiple phases would crossover. After wrapping up the first sprint, the second sprint consisted mainly of conducting some forms of research on the users needs, after which the group quickly headed into the designing phase. 
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              These were at first mainly sketches and wireframes of rough ideas. After this, the corporate identity was created, and functionalities were being worked out into the wireframes. While the corporate identity was being created, I was mainly focused on learning more about user research methods, and finding applicable methods for the eventual testing and validation of the app.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              After wrapping up the wireframes and corporate identity, final decisions were made on functionalities we were keeping in the app. Eventually, we ended up with four main functionalities in the app. These were the daily dose, insights, calendar and content page.
            </p>
            <div class="column">
              <p class="company">
                When everybody was clear on what the intended outcome of the designs was going to be, everyone started working in pairs on the design. For me, I was working together with Julien. We split tasks of the pages and ended up with our final set of mock-ups.
              </p>
              <p class="company">
                After everyone completed their designs, final decisions were made on what design aspects were going to be taken into accountability for the final prototype. I was glad to see that many functions of my calendar page were taken by the group, since this is where my focus was the most.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="desc">The designs were put together in a final prototype, which meant that the product was ready for the testing phase. I had previously done research on user research methods, but no clear idea on what needed to be tested was justified. This was something the group looked at together. Based on what needed to be tested, suitable research methods were chosen and worked out.</p>
            <p class="desc">This ended up in a user research plan, which was eventually conducted with users to validate the final product. Besides the final product, I have also worked on proof of concepts of specific functionalities of the app.</p>

            <h2 class="guide">REFLECTION & EVALUATION</h2>
            <p class="desc">
              During the group project, I have learned several things. The main thing is working with SCRUM in a group manner. I had never done this before, and since having a clear understanding on SCRUM, I was glad to apply my knowledge within the group, but there were still things I did not know about working a group manner.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              Furthermore, I have learned that the task of being a SCRUM master requires a lot of initiative, which was not something I was used to, but glad to have experienced. I have also worked on some development for the proof of concepts of this project. This was also in a group manner which helped me learn more about version management in group projects. In short, these are my learning points:
              <ul class="target-list">
                <li>Working with SCRUM in a group manner.</li>
                <li>Working with a group in a Figma file in a professional manner.</li>
                <li>Communication within the group and with stakeholders.</li>
                <li>Version management with multiple group members.</li>
