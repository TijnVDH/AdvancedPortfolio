                This deliverable page presents a summary of the user research plan which has been conducted with users of the portfolio. The page gives a summary of the process which has been taken, from setting up goals to execution. It is suggested to read through this summary first for a better understanding, after which to use the button at the bottom of the page to refer to as the actual proof document.

          The duration of the project was three weeks. During these three weeks I have had weekly meetings with my semester coach, Bardt, who also happens to be the most prominent stakeholder. These meetings were mainly update meetings. However, some occasions also demanded to be used
          for an expert interview, and as user research. Since Bardt is the main assessor, it is very useful to make us of this in order to get valuable feedback.
        </p>
        <div class="column">
          <p class="company">
            During my third-year internship. I started working with the SCRUM way of working. During this internship period I was working alone, and this way of working suited me very well. This is the reason why during this individual project I have also worked with SCRUM.
          </p>
          <p class="company">
            I have worked in sprints of one week, which meant that there was a total of three sprints. After each weak, I had to have finished specific tasks from the backlog, and this is when I had update meetings with Bardt where we disccused my progress.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="desc">
          Initially, I had planned out each project phase to last one week. Of course, a project as this will always be an iterative process, which meant that at some moments, I was working on multiple phases simultaneously. An example for this is: after having a design ready, user research
          was still necessary to either iterate or validate the design concept. This was also the main reason why the eventual development phase did not receive as much as attention as originally intended. This meant that the end result was satisfactory, but not to the extent as I had wished.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Execution</h3>
        <p class="desc">
          I started this project by setting up the project plan. This project plan included the plan of approach, research questions, scope etc. The main research question for this project was as follows:
          <ul class="target-list">
            <li>How do I present myself as a professional media designer in a clear and structured portfolio?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="column">
          <p class="company">
            Based on this main question, I had set up several sub questions, which can be found inside of the project plan. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="desc">
          After receiving feedback from Bardt on my research questions, it was time to start the actual research phase. One of my sub questions was about using a front-end framework for the creation of my portfolio. I started by conducting secondary research, which mainly consisted out of desk research.
          The results from this research were very broad, which did not allow me to draw a concrete answer to my research question. This meant that I had to do some form of primary research to gather some qualitative insights.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          I had an expert interview with Bardt. Since Bardt is a front-end architect, he has enough experience to advise me in the use of a front-end framework, which also helped me to draw my final conclusion on the research question.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          After having answered several sub questions, it was time to start on creating the structure of my portfolio. This consisted of creating wireframes in a quick succession. After this, I had a clear view of the structure I wanted to accomplish with the portfolio.
          This meant that I could quickly receive peer feedback on the portfolio structure, and in no-time I was started on the design.
        </p>
        <div class="column">
          <p class="company">
            The designing phase took longer than expected, which is not particularly a bad thing, because I could get plenty of user insights with the help of the research plan I set up, especially dedicated for gathering thoughts on the user experience of my portfolio.
          </p>
          <p class="company">
            After receiving valuable insights, I started developing. The remaining time to work on development was limited, which caused me to only have worked on the homepage of the portfolio. Of course, this is not the end of the world, since I had the whole semester to keep working on it.
