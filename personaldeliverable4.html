              Since this is my seventh semester of my bachelor, my next semester will be my graduation semester. I have tried multiple sources which might have helped me find a graduation internship.

        <p class="desc">I started out by renewing my CV. Which can be seen <a class="menu-link line" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rljU8u2-uJsfELrHXF6eax60GkYiV2UH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="company">
                After this I reached out out to my connection where I found my previous internship. Unfortunately, there was no assignment he could come up with/forward me to. 
            </p>
            <p class="company">
                After this, I knew I had to start looking at other possibilities, so I started looking on ASAM, from which I applied to some assignments, but nothing I was really excited about.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="desc">After realizing that I could do my graduation internship within the FHICT lectorate, I immediately took the chance and reached out to the contact person. He then forwarded me to Dennis (which was also our stakeholder).</p>
        <p class="desc">Dennis had a list of assignments for me, from which two really stood out to me. Eventually I leaned towards the People's Peephole project more. This was because I was looking for a Media Design assignment, while still having Game Design aspects twisted in there. Because no other company offered something like this, I knew the lectorate was the right spot for me.</p>
        <p class="desc">I reached out to the project owner Woody to arrange a meeting. In this meeting I received more information on what the project is about. Woody told me that the project is quite open, from which I created a project proposal basically from scratch.</p>
        <p class="desc">Woody and Angela were both excited about what I was planning to do during my graduation period, and after some iterations the project proposal will (hopefully) be approved.</p>
