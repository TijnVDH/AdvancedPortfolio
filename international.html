            <p class="desc">
                Welcome to the reading guide of the international project for this semester! In this reading guide, the international project and the Malage tripp will be discussed, and third-year reflection and evaluation.
                At the bottom of this reading guide, you will find a proof section containing all deliverables related to this project. These deliverables are linked specifically to learning outcome 7.
                The deliverables from this project, and all other projects are also directly accessible from the competence table on the homepage. The difference
                is that on the homepage, all deliverables are sorted by learning outcomes, while this page only contains deliverables for this specific project.

            <h2 class="guide">THE PROJECT</h2>
            <p class="desc">The international week was based around the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven. The Dutch Design Week had a total of 10 narratives. Together with an international student from Toronto, our group project group worked together on one of these narratives. The chosen narrative for us was:
              <ul class="target-list">
                <li>Product & Craft Design.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
              <p class="desc">
                  With this narrative in mind, we started exploring the Dutch Design Week. In the Dutch Design Week, we came across a lot of sustainability projects, which was something that was taken into our final product.
              </p>
              <p class="desc">
                For the Malaga trip, I visited the WeyWeyWeb Conference. This was a conference where talks and workshops were given about several topics redaring web design and development.

            <p class="desc">
              Everyone of the group wrote down what they liked, and with brainstorming we figured out what we wanted to move forward with.

            <div class="column">

                We knew that we wanted to create a physical proudct that would take effect on sustainability. You can find more about the process and final product in this deliverable.

              <p class="company">
                For the Malaga trip, I went in without any expectations, and decided to let it come to me. Unfortunately, the talks that were presented on the days itself were of little interest to me.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="desc">
              I attended a few talks on the days of the conference, but I could not find anything that added to my current knowledge and experience.

            <h2 class="guide">REFLECTION & EVALUATION</h2>
            <p class="desc">
              During the international project, I have mainly learned to communicate within an international context. For the international project it meant getting accustomed with the cultural differences of the new Canadian group member, and for the Malaga trip this meant listening to interpretations and point of views from talks from experts from all over the world.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              As for professional development, I unfortunately do not have a lot of things I learned that I can take with me in the future. For the international week however, we had only an afternoon to create our product, which meant that we had to act fast, and we were all surprised how well the teamwork went, which ended us with an end product we were all happy with. For the Malaga trip, as already mentioned, the talks were nice to listen to, but were of little added value. Hearing experiences from experts was interesting, but I think for me it is a form of experimenting myself and learning along the way. The field of ICT & Media is a field where you learn as you go, even in the workfield, which is the way I want to learn. These are the main learning points for me:
              <ul class="target-list">
                <li>Creating a product related to the Dutch Design Week in a short time period.
                </li>
                <li>Working in a team form together with Canadian culture.</li>
              </ul>

              Below you can find the proof section of this project. Each deliverable has a title, and its related learning outcomes abbreviated as "LO". You can find more information about a specific deliverable by clicking on them. Most deliverables have a link at the bottom of the page, which
              reference towards its connected research document.
