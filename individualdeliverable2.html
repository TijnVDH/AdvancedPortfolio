              This deliverable page presents the documentation of the wireframing and designing process of the portfolio. After having answered several sub-questions, it was time to start structuring the portfolio. I started doing this by creating wireframes in a quick succession.

        These wireframes were very low fidelity, but after using peer feedback I could validate that the structure of the portfolio was clear. This meant that I could quickly start with the actual design of the portfolio.

        The start of the design phase was a bit rough. Making design choices such as colors, typefaces and spacing took longer than expected, which was not particularly a bad thing, but I wish I could have went through this in a more fluent succession. On the other hand, since it took longer for me to make certain choices, I dedicated more time to asking for feedback on certain aspects of the portfolio. This helped with creating a portfolio design I am sufficed with.

      <p class="desc">
        I also wanted my design to be in a sleek dark mode, since this is how I usually create my sites. Below you can see the design which has been created based on the earlier created wireframes.

        After finishing my design, I turned my mockups into a functional prototype. This is the prototype I used to execute my USER RESEARCH PLAN. After having executed this user research plan, I noticed that the overall structure is clear, but the portfolio was still missing some features. I decided to create a diagram of the final structure. This structure still has the same idea, but with added features, such as the competence table, and other additional projects.

      <p class="desc">Adding these additional features, meant that these also needed to be worked out. Something I realized during update meetings with Bardt, is that the competence table really acts as the core of the portfolio, where the proof is gathered. This meant that I took some time to work out the design of the competence table, which can be seen down below. </p>
