              This deliverable page presents a summary of the front-end framework research that has been done. The process of approach, and the main results and conclusions will be discussed. At the bottom of the page you can find a button which directs towards the full research document. It is suggested to read through the summary first, after which the research document can be used as the official proof.

          <p class="company">
            During my studies at Fontys ICT, I have programmed mainly in JavaScript, but I have never before worked with a front-end framework. This is the reason why I wanted to research whether the individual project is the right place to apply learning a front-end framework.
          </p>
          <p class="company">
            While I was working on my third-year internship, I noticed that all of the company's web applications are built with the help of a front-end framework. Hence why I have gotten interest in learning a front-end framework. During, and after my internship I have not gotten the chance to start learning, but this semester seems like a right time.

          <li>How does a front-end framework assist me with developing my portfolio?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="desc">
          After having my research question, I set up specific terms which I used to conduct my secondary research, in order to answer my research question. Using mainly articles, YouTube video's and blogs, I noticed that I was not able to answer my research question,
          since all of my sources concluded the same thing: it all comes down to personal preference. This was an answer I could not do anything with, which meant that I had to dive deeper into research.

        <h3 class="subtitle">Expert interview</h3>
        <p class="desc">
          By making use of the expert interview from the DOT-framework, I would be able to get clarifaction on whether a front-end framework would assist me with creating my portfolio. Since my semestercoach Bardt is also a front-end architect, he has plenty of experience working with front-end frameworks.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          I prepared several questions, and during the expert interview, it has clarified that the use of a front-end framework for this project would not be of any added value, because of the limited time that was left, and that I should work with the knowledge that I already have.

            <p class="company">
              Based on the results I gathered from this research, I can safely conclude that a framework will not be used for this portfolio project. Learning a framework has many advantages, for example for consistency in big projects.
            </p>
            <p class="company">
              However, there is little added value for using a framework in my portfolio. This is mainly due to the time constraints and its learning curve. I will however be working with a front-end framework in my personal project.
