                Welcome to the reading guide of the individual project for this semester! In this reading guide, various topics will be discussed, including the project, process, reflection and evaluation.
                At the bottom of this reading guide, you will find a proof section containing all deliverables related to this project. These deliverables have certain learning outcomes attached to them, which
                are visisble when hovering over said deliverables. The deliverables from this project, and all other projects are also directly accessible from the competence table on the homepage. The difference
                is that on the homepage, all deliverables are sorted by learning outcomes, while this page only contains deliverables for this specific project.

            <p class="desc">This project is based around creating your own portfolio for this semester. The end goal for this project was to have a validated portfolio design, with a setup for development, which acts as a stepping stone. 
              For this setup of development, future projects can easily be added with the same process.</p>
              <div class="column">
                <p class="company">
                    At the end of the semester, the portfolio acts as the big piece of evidence for the work of the semester. By starting working on the portfolio at early stages of the semester is a great opportunity to learn, while also
                    documenting the work that is being done.
                </p>
                <p class="company">
                    The portfolio consists mainly of three projects, from which this is one. The target audience for the portfolio are mainly teachers and/or assessors, but the portfolio could also be used to present to other students, or for finding
                    future jobs.

              The duration of the project was three weeks. During these three weeks I have had weekly meetings with my semester coach, Bardt, who also happens to be the most prominent stakeholder. These meetings were mainly update meetings. However, some occasions also demanded to be used
              for an expert interview, and as user research. Since Bardt is the main assessor, it is very useful to make us of this in order to get valuable feedback.

                During my third-year internship. I started working with the SCRUM way of working. During this internship period I was working alone, and this way of working suited me very well. This is the reason why during this individual project I have also worked with SCRUM.
              </p>
              <p class="company">
                I have worked in sprints of one week, which meant that there was a total of three sprints. After each weak, I had to have finished specific tasks from the backlog, and this is when I had update meetings with Bardt where we disccused my progress.
