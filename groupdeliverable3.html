          This deliverable page presents a summary of the research on user testing methods which has been done by me and another group member. It is suggested to read through this summary first for a better understanding, after which to use the button at the bottom of the page to refer to as the actual proof document. The linked research question to this deliverable is:
          <ul class="target-list">
            <li>How can we test the UI/UX of the app?</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="desc">When starting out with the <a class="menu-link line" href="groupdeliverable2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user testing plan</a>, there was still no design, and I had no idea what was going to be tested. Still, I thought it was a good idea to go on the hunt for possible research methods which might be suitable for this project.</p>

        <h2 class="guide">EXECUTION</h2>
        <p class="desc">To start, a distinction was made between several types of research methods (Rohrer, 2024):
          <ul class="target-list">
            <li>Attitudinal or behavioral</li>
            <li>Moderated or unmoderated</li>
            <li>Remote or face-to-face</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="desc">After this, several research methods were chosen for which these types are applicable:
          <ul class="target-list">
            <li>Usability testing</li>
            <li>Guerrilla testing</li>
            <li>A/B testing</li>
            <li>Card Sorting</li>
            <li>5-second test</li>
            <li>Eye Tracking</li>
            <li>Screen Recording</li>
            <li>Contextual Inquiry</li>
            <li>The System Usability Scale (SUS)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="desc">By having a clear overview on what each method does, and its advantages and disadvantages, a decision on which method(s) would be used during the actual conducting of user testing would be easier to make. As for now, the list of research methods could be slimmed down to four specific research methods:
          <ul class="target-list">
            <li>Usability testing</li>
            <li>A/B testing</li>
            <li>5-second test</li>
            <li>The System Usability Scale (SUS)</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="guide">CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS</h2>
        <p class="desc">After having a clear overview on potential user testing methods, a list of action points for the rest of the project rolled out. After sitting with Rose, some aspects that in her eyes needed to be looked at were added to this list of action points. These action points were as follows:
          <ul class="target-list">
            <li>Working on the prototype for the app, and based on what needs to be tested, choose research method(s)</li>
            <li>Cite used sources in future research documents.</li>
          </ul>
