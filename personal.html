            <p class="desc">
                Welcome to the reading guide of the personal project for this semester! In this reading guide, various topics will be discussed, including the starting phase of this project. The project is still in progress, but a start was made during the end of this semster.
                At the bottom of this reading guide, you will find a proof section containing all deliverables related to this project. These deliverables have certain learning outcomes attached to them, which
                are visisble when hovering over said deliverables. The deliverables from this project, and all other projects are also directly accessible from the competence table on the homepage. The difference
                is that on the homepage, all deliverables are sorted by learning outcomes, while this page only contains deliverables for this specific project.

            <h2 class="guide">THE PROJECT</h2>
            <p class="desc">This project is based around personal learning goals. During the individual project, a start on front-end framework research was done. I thought it would be a good idea to apply this further into a personal project.</p>
              <div class="column">
                <p class="company">
                    My mother owns an acupuncture company, and the website is really outdated. After being asked to revamp the website, I had the idea that I could start learning a front-end framework simultaneously with this.
                </p>
                <p class="company">
                    The website is pure front-end, and acts as an invitation card to customers, which means that there is no back-end attached to the website. This meant that I could fully immerse into the front-end framework, and build something fresh and new. 
                </p>

            <h2 class="guide">PROCESS</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Approach</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              The current website is outdated, but the information is still valid. This means that I could use the information architecture that is currently existent in website, and apply this to my revamped design.
            </p>
            <div class="column">
              <p class="company">
                Everything else was open for interpretation for me, as long as the new website had a "modern" feel. 
              </p>
              <p class="company">
                This meant that I could fully go out in the design part as well, but I had to keep in consideration that what I designed, is also technically reachable.
              </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Execution</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              For this project I had set up one main research question:
              <ul class="target-list">
                <li>How do create a modernized website for my mothers company with the help of a front-end framework?</li>
