          <p class="desc">
              To assist learning outcome three, Bardt and Stan have given us the opportunity to work on a programming project on the side. I had decided to join in on Stan's project, since he was mainly focusing on animations in websites, which is something is was most interested in.

      <h2 class="guide">START</h2>
      <p class="desc">During the first session, I managed to get the start-up project that Stan created running with Vite. From here, I added a new class named Menu.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="desc">After doing this, animating different components in the website was straightforward. However, I did not get the chance to do a lot of animations for this project, because the group challenge was still the priority, which caused me to leave this project on the side.</p>

      <h2 class="guide">EVALUATION</h2>
      <p class="desc">At the end of the semester, I do not have a lot to show for this project that is different than the barebones project that I started off with. I did however gain some learning points that I am taking with me:
        <ul class="target-list">
          <li>An introduction to using Vite and gsap which was actually quite easier to use than I had anticpated.</li>
          <li>What type of variables can be used to animate specific components in JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
